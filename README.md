# Combined-MultiFunctional-Calculator
This was my first attempt back in 2021 (my ninth grade) to make a multifunctional program that can deal with multiple tasks, and this application is an advanced financial tool for calculating math, predicting bank deposit dynamics, and most interesting part - stock market tracking view with statistics and even graphic of the ticket price

I spent 1 month on it and i dealt with many problems.
I learned:
How to make a plan for developing such as large programm with no skills at GUI and API technology.
How to analyze what market of tools offers us.
How to design my first application with functions and graphics.

By the way, project had a lot of steps of upgrading and reworking before i could submit it to the project competition among the students
This is my first major independent work so i can present it to you with pride.
